# TreeShaping
This repo showcases the Tree Shaping method by comparing it against other known techniques.
It served as a live code example in my Masters Thesis [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nAhiJ1f3A77JOs03040rvroKHV6kOKEJo21WW8JTO5E/edit?usp=sharing)

The method was used in building [PULER](https://github.com/bmabsout/PULER)
Running the examples can be done via cloning the repo and calling:
```
nix develop
codium .
./run.sh
```
Once any of the files in `src/` are saved, the diagram.svg previewed by `feh` will be automatically updated.
